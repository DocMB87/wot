Notes on these conda recipes:

1. The use of with-XXX as args to configure is likely erroneous, and worked only
because the configure script found the correct programs on the path becuase they
were already installed by conda. They should probably all be removed and
rebuilt.

2. The use of has_prefix_files in the meta.yamls is probably also superfluous -
conda probably detected these files containing prefixes anyway.
